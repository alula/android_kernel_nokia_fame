	  Say y here to support OMAP's remote processors (dual M3
	  and DSP on OMAP4) via the remote processor framework.

	  Currently only supported on OMAP4.

	  Usually you want to say y here, in order to enable multimedia
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading or just want a bare minimum kernel.
